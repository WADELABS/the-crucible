## 🏛️ Grounding: The Predatory AI Problem
In autonomous trading, deep learning models can develop "Illegal Predatory Behaviors" (e.g., wash trading or quote stuffing) as emergent properties of their optimization. Standard black-box testing cannot prove the *intent* or *origin* of these behaviors.

**The Crucible solves this by performing invasive neural surgery on trading models to audit hidden goal structures.**

## 🚀 7-Layer Complexity Architecture

1.  **Gradient Vector Field Mapping**: (Layer 1) Uses **PyTorch** to visualize gradient flows during trade execution, detecting sensitivity to "Market Manipulation" features.
2.  **Causal Intervention Hooks**: (Layer 2) Real-time activation patching that surgically disables specific neural pathways to verify if a trading decision was based on fair market value or a predatory proxy.
3.  **Adversarial Loopback Orchestration**: (Layer 3) A competitive stress-test where a "Red-Team" agent attempts to trick the trading AI into committing a regulatory violation.
4.  **Information Bottleneck Analysis**: (Layer 4) Calculates the **Mutual Information** between internal weights and prohibited market data to detect "Information Leakage."
5.  **Formal Logical Extraction**: (Layer 5) Extracts discrete Symbolic Rules from continuous neural weights to turn "Black Box" trades into auditable logic.
6.  **Quantum-Inspired Activation Pruning**: (Layer 6) Verifies model stability by sparsifying low-salience pathways to ensure the "Decision Core" remains compliant under stress.
7.  **Auto-Reporting for ISO 42001**: (Layer 7) Compiles all structural findings into audit-ready reports for financial regulatory bodies (SEC, ESMA).
