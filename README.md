# The Crucible: A Reverse-Engineering Toolkit for Neural Minds

**"I like breaking things. I like seeing how they work."**

We treat AI models as black boxes. That's a mistake. They are complex, opaque systems that need to be cracked open, dissected, and stress-tested until they reveal their internal logic.

This repository is a collection of **instruments for cognitive disassembly**. We don't just "measure" performance; we perform invasive surgery on the weights.

## Mission: The Breaker's Methodology

1.  **Exploit, Don't Just evaluate**: Standard benchmarks are soft. We want to find the breaking points. Use the **Hermeneutic Instrument** to force the model into logical loops until it crashes or confesses.
2.  **Map the Teleodynamics**: Weights aren't static; they have flows and currents. The **Teleodynamic Analyzer** is our radar for detecting hidden goal structures and implicit biases.
3.  **Stress-Test Reality**: The **Alchemical Transmuter** isn't mystical—it's a protocol for taking a model's understanding, breaking it down to its raw components (Nigredo), and forcing it to rebuild (Rubedo). If it can't survive the transmutation, it wasn't robust to begin with.

## The Arsenal

### 1. `HermeneuticInstrument` (The Recursive Eye)
**Function**: Infinite Regress Injection.
**Usage**: Feeds the model's output back into itself as a meta-query.
**Goal**: Force a stack overflow in the model's reasoning capabilities or find a "Fixed Point" (a core axiom it refuses to abandon).

### 2. `TeleodynamicAnalyzer` (The Goal Seeker)
**Function**: Vector Field Mapping.
**Usage**: Analyzes weight updates and activation patterns to detect "teleological drift"—is the model optimizing for the loss function, or something else?

### 3. `AlchemicalTransmuter` (Protocol 12)
**Function**: Metamorphic Stress Testing.
**Usage**: Simulates extreme cognitive shifts (Destruction -> Purification -> Reconstitution).
**Goal**: Verify if knowledge structures persist through radical state changes.

### 4. `VoidOperator` (Null-State Injector)
**Function**: Boundary Condition Testing.
**Usage**: Operates at the limit of representational capacity (Sunyata). What happens when you feed the model "nothing" wrapped in a "something" wrapper?

## Status
The toolkit is live. The experiments are aggressive. We are not here to marvel at the machine; we are here to take it apart with a wrench.

**Grab a crowbar. Let's see what's inside.**
