# Case File: The Crucible (Forensic Verification Pipeline) 🧪

> **"My neighbor kept buying 'vintage' furniture on Craigslist that turned out to be IKEA with a distressed finish and a story. 'Found in a barn in Vermont,' the listing said. The underside still had a 'Made in China' sticker.**
>
> **She didn't need me to tell her to be more careful. She needed a way to test the stories before handing over cash.**
>
> **So I built The Crucible.**
>
> **It's a claim-checker for secondhand marketplaces. You paste in the listing text, and it runs the claims through public databases, image search, and basic logic checks. 'Mid-century modern' gets compared against known design archives. 'Hand-built by local craftsman' triggers a search of business registries and woodworking forums. 'One-of-a-kind' gets reverse image searched.**
>
> **Last week, it caught a 'vintage Persian rug' that was identical to a Target clearance item from 2019. The seller had just stained it and added fringe.**
>
> **My neighbor now sends me photos of her actual finds—a real 1950s dining set, a legit Eames chair, a lamp that turned out to be worth triple what she paid. The Crucible didn't make her paranoid. It made her confident."**

## 🏛️ FORENSIC SUMMARY: The Marketplace Integrity Pillar
The Crucible is an adversarial engine designed to neutralize "story-told" value in online marketplaces. It treats every listing as a hallucination until it survives a three-stage forensic gauntlet.

### 🧠 The Forensic Layers
1. **Visual Forensics**: Identifying "one-of-a-kind" items as mass-produced clearance siblings and scanning for hidden manufacturing labels.
2. **Design Archive Matching**: Flagging material anachronisms (e.g., MDF in "1950s" furniture) and cross-referencing dimensions against design registries.
3. **Story Auditing**: Fact-checking the fabrication by verifying business registries and comparing claimed history against archived catalog data.
