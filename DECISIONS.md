# Design Decisions: The Crucible

### Objective: AI Safety & Model Robustness

- **Decision 1: Teleodynamic Analysis**: We chose to implement gradient vector field mapping for Layer 1 to provide a visual foundation for neural sensitivity analysis.
- **Decision 2: Adversarial Loopbacks**: Implemented as competitive agents to ensure safety alignment is not just static but dynamic under stress.
- **Decision 3: Zero Emoji Constraint**: All external communication and telemetry reporting is restricted to authoritative, direct language to ensure professional alignment with AI Safety research standards.
